/**
 * Implementation of confusables tables in <a
 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39">Unicode TR39</a>.
 * <p>
 * To see whether two strings X and Y are confusable according to a given table
 * (abbreviated as X ‚âÖ Y), use  {@link Skeleton}.
 * <p>
 * The data is organized into four different tables, depending on the desired
 * parameters. Each table provides a mapping from source characters to target
 * strings. On the basis of this data, there are three main classes of
 * confusable strings:
 * <p>
 * Definitions:
 * <p>
 * 
 * X and Y are single-script confusables if they are confusable according to the
 * Single-Script table, and each of them is a single script string according to
 * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Mixed_Script_Detection">Section
 * 5, Mixed-Script Detection</a>, and it is the same script for each.
 * <p>
 * Examples: "soÃ∑s" and "s√∏s" in Latin, where the first word has the character
 * "o" followed by the character U+0337 ( Ã∑  ) COMBINING SHORT SOLIDUS OVERLAY.
 * <p>
 * X and Y are <a
 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#mixed_script_confusables"
 * >mixed-script confusables</a> if they are confusable according to the
 * Mixed-Script table, and they are not single-script confusables.
 * <p>
 * Examples: "paypal" and "p–∞yp–∞l", where the second word has the character
 * U+0430 ( –∞ ) CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A.
 * <p>
 * X and Y are <a
 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#whole_script_confusables"
 * >whole-script confusables</a> if they are mixed-script confusables, and each
 * of them is a single script string.
 * <p>
 * Example: "scope" in Latin and "—ï—Å–æ—Ä–µ" in Cyrillic.
 * <p>
 * The mixed script any case table is the most complete. It is thus the recommended table to use,
 * unless there is a strong reason to use one of the others.
